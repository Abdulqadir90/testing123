<hr>

<h3>Rush Hour 2</h3>
<p>Their contrasting styles (serious vs. chaotic) create a natural “buddy cop” dynamic that feels effortless.</p>

<h3>City of God</h3>
<p>Based on true events in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.
It doesn’t sugarcoat crime, poverty, or social issues—giving the audience an authentic, 
gritty look at life in the slums.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>It combines hard sci-fi with deeply human stakes, making the story both intellectually engaging and emotionally resonant.</p>
